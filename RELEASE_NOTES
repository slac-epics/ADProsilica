ADProsilica-R2-0_1-0:  Initial RELEASE for ICD: Prosilica Gig-E Camera: (Developed by Mark Rivers, Univ of Chicago))
                       -- ELW: Add config files to point to the location of SZIP and HDF
                          within the buildroot linuxRT OS and toolchain:
                          added <>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.Common.linuxRT-x86
                          added <>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.Common.linuxRT-x86_64
                        -- ELW: Install vendor library and header for use by linuxRT
                                Note the vendor library was probably built with glibc
                                Our linuxRT targets use uClibc.  I hope this is okay
                                I copied the venors x86_64 bit library to the 
                                linuxRT-x86_64 directory and similar for the 32-bit
                                vendor library.
                                Note: Would be nice if we had the vendor's source code. :)
